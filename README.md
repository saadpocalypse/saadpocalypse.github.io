This repository was made as an assignment for my Web-app Development Course (CSCS 342). <br>
The objective was to get familiar with Boostrap and HTML. 

## Assignment 1
Make your Portfolio using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Your portfolio must have following features:
1. A Home Page which includes your name, interests and other basic information. It must also contain a picture of you.
2. A Projects Page with a list of all your projects briefly described.
3. A Resume Page where your Resume is displayed as a pdf and is downloadable.
4. A Contact Page where users can send you projects after providing their name, email address, subject and project details.
5. The portfolio should be responsive.
<br>

The finished product was to be hosted on Github Pages. You can visit my deployed portfolio by clicking [here.](https://saadpocalypse.github.io)

I also added some JavaScript elements to the portfolio. <br>
The script I added is for darkmode on some of the pages. <br>
However, I did not use cookies to store the sessions so the state is not carried onto the next page or across page reloads. <br>
Dark mode NOT working properly on Safari
